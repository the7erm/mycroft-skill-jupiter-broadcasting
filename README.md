# mycroft-skill-jupiter-broadcasting
My 2nd attempt at creating a mycroft skill

This is a 3rd party skill that can either reside in `~/.mycroft/skills/` or `/opt/mycroft/skills` .

## Install
```
mkdir -p ~/.mycroft/skills/
cd ~/.mycroft/skills/
git clone https://github.com/the7erm/mycroft-skill-jupiter-broadcasting.git jupiter_broadcasting
source ~/.virtualenvs/mycroft/bin/activate
# if that doesn't work try `source <path to virtualenv/bin/activate>`
pip install -r requirements.txt
# restart mycroft
./mycroft.sh restart
```

## Configuring `mycroft.ini`
By default the `JBSkill` uses `xdg-open` to open media & webpages.
Everyone has their favorite media player feel free to set it to `vlc` please
note `vlc --flag` will not work.  You'll need to write a wrapper script that
calls `vlc` with the command line arguments you'd like.

`mycroft.ini` can be changed in either `/etc/mycroft/mycroft.ini` for system wide configuration or `$HOME/.mycroft/mycroft.ini` for a specific user.

```ini
[JbSkill]
webpage_command = xdg-open
media_command = xdg-open
```

## feedcache
The JbSkill will only fetch a podcast once per hour.
`~/.mycroft/skills/JbSkill/feedcache` is the location of the cache file.


In the event that the device you want your media to play/view isn't the same box as you run mycroft on you'll want to read [ssh how to](https://github.com/the7erm/mycroft-skill-jupiter-broadcasting/blob/master/how-to/how-to-ssh.md).
